**Description**
---------------

Please note, this is a very early beta prototype.

This is a GTK 3.x application that allows easy timestamped note taking for video clips.

Clips may be played from local files, or streamed from remote sources such as YouTube.

It acts as an interface to control the excellent Open Source MPV player, at: https://mpv.io/.

The application depends on super Open Source project that provides Python bindings to the MPV
player, at: https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv

Notes are saved in a user nominated directory as YAML files. These are easily human
readable and editable.
