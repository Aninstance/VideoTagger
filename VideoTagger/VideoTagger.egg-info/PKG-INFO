        **Description**
        ---------------
        
        Please note, this is a very early beta prototype.
        
        This is a GTK 3.x application that allows easy timestamped note taking for video clips.
        
        It acts as an interface to control the excellent Open Source MPV player, at: https://mpv.io/.
        
        Clips may be played from local files, or streamed from remote sources such as YouTube.
        
        Existing notes are stored as simple YAML files, which may be read and edited from within
        the application. Videos may be restarted at note's timestamp on the click of a button.
        
        The application depends on a super Open Source project that provides Python bindings to the MPV
        player, at: https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv
        
        Notes are saved in a user nominated directory as YAML files. These are easily human
        readable and editable.
        
        ------------
        **Features**
        ------------
        
        - Take timestamped notes at any point in a video at the tap of a button.
        - Run, control and note-take on video streams.
        - Read and edit existing notes from the application.
        - Start video from a note's timestamp at the click of a button.
