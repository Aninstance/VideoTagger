Description: =================
        **Description**
        =================
        
        Please note, this is a very early beta ...
        
        This is a GTK 3.x application that allows easy timestamped note taking for video clips.
        
        It acts as an interface to control the excellent Open Source MPV player, at: https://mpv.io/.
        
        The application builds on an Open Source project that provides Python bindings to the MPV
        player, at: https://github.com/jaseg/python-mpv
        
        Notes are saved in a user nominated directory as YAML files. These are easily human
        readable and editable.
        
        ============
        **Features**
        ============
        
        - Take timestamped notes at any point in a video at the tap of a button.
        - Run, control and note-take on multiple video streams simultaneously.
        
        ===========
        **Usage**
        ===========
        
        - Type or paste a video file URL (either a local file, or remote) into the "Video Source" field.
          Video files can also be dragged into this field - the source should automatically populate.
        
        - Wait for the video to begin playing. The video should open in MPV player.
        
        - A video session ID will appear in the main application window. The needs to be selected by
          a single click/tap. Once selected, it will be highlighted. It is important to ensure that
          the session you wish to control is selected. Multiple streams may be controlled by
          selecting the appropriate ID before using the control bar to control the selected session.
        
        - The video may be controlled via the application's control bar:
        
          - Play button: Plays the video.
          - Back button: Seeks back by 5 seconds (unit of time should be user definable in future versions).
          - Stop button: Stops the video and destroys the instance. Only click this if you're done.
          - Pause button: Pauses or resumes from a paused state.
          - Forward button: Seeks forward by 5 seconds (unit of time should be user definable in future).
          - "OSD" button: Toggles MPV's 'On Screen Display'.
          - "Take Note" button: Tap this to take a note. This will pause the player and open up a timestamped
            note. The user will also be prompted to select a directory in which to store the note if that has
            note already been selected earlier in video play session. Users should be aware that clicking
            the Stop button will destroy the video session for that stream, and so subsequent opening of the
            same video will require reselection of the storage directory. Once the note has been taken
            (or cancelled), the player should automatically resume playing.

        =============
        **Roadmap**
        =============
        
        - Allow reading and editing of existing notes within applications (*PRIORITY).
        - Allow user defined player seek steps (code note: add func e.g. VideoPlayers().set_player_seek_forward_time()).
        - Write to a log file and allow users to define the level at which messages are logged (e.g. info, error).
        - Add additional storage methods (database, etc).
        - Make API available to access notes through web gui.
        - Lots more ...
