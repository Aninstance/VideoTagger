Basic Usage Instructions

    * Type or paste a video file URL (either a local file, or remote) into the "Video Source" field.
      Video files can also be dragged into this field - the source should automatically populate.

    * Wait for the video to begin playing. The video should open in MPV player.

    * A video session ID will appear in the main application window, which may be selected by a click.

    * The video may be controlled via the application's control bar:

      - Play button: Plays the video.

      - Back button: Seeks back by 5 seconds (unit of time should be user definable in future versions).

      - Stop button: Stops the video and destroys the instance. Only click this if you're done.

      - Pause button: Pauses or resumes from a paused state.

      - Forward button: Seeks forward by 5 seconds (unit of time should be user definable in future).

      - "OSD" button: Toggles MPV's 'On Screen Display'.

      - "Take Note" button: Tap this to take a note. This will pause the player and open up a timestamped
        note. The user will also be prompted to select a directory in which to store the note if no
        directory has already been defined.

      - Users should be aware that clicking the Stop button will destroy the video session for that stream,
        and so subsequent opening of the same video will require reselection of the storage directory.
        Once the note has been taken (or cancelled), the player should automatically resume playing.
