Basic Usage Instructions

    * Type or paste a video file URL (either a local file, or remote) into the "Video Source" field.
      Video files can also be dragged into this field - the source should automatically populate.

    * Wait for the video to begin playing. The video should open in MPV player.

    * A video session ID will appear in the main application window, which may be selected by a click.

    * The video may be controlled via the application's control bar:

      - Play button: Plays the video.

      - Back button: Seeks back by 5 seconds (unit of time should be user definable in future versions).

      - Stop button: Stops the video and destroys the instance. Only click this if you're done.

      - Pause button: Pauses or resumes from a paused state.

      - Forward button: Seeks forward by 5 seconds (unit of time should be user definable in future).

      - "OSD" button: Toggles MPV's 'On Screen Display'.

      - "Take Note" button: Tap this to take a note. This will pause the player and open up a timestamped
        note. The user will also be prompted to select a directory in which to store the note if no
        directory has already been defined.

      - Users should be aware that clicking the Stop button will destroy the video session for that stream,
        and so subsequent opening of the same video will require reselection of the storage directory.
        Once the note has been taken (or cancelled), the player should automatically resume playing.

    * Existing notes are stored as simple YAML files, which may be read and edited from within
      the application as follows:

      - Click "Read & Edit Notes" and select the notes file to edit from the file chooser dialog.
        You will find the file saved in the directory you chose when making the note, in yaml format.
        The filename should match the title of the video. Select the file and click "Select".

      - A "Note Editor" dialog should now appear, presenting existing notes under their respective timestamps.

          - Click on the large arrows to expand/compact the timestamps and expose/hide the attached note.

          - To edit a note, click once on it's text to display in the editor pane (to the right).

          - Edit the note in the editor pane, then click "Save Note". Job done!
          The notes file will now have been updated to reflect your changes.

          - To begin playing a video source from a note timestamp, ensure a note is selected, then
          click on the "Play Video" button. Any existing videos will close and a new MPV instance will
          open to play the video source, starting 5 seconds before the timestamp. The 5 second difference
          is to provide a lead-in context to the video clip (this setting may be user defined).
